"El curso tiene información muy básica, usan buen lenguaje, de fácil entendimiento para el público en general, sin embargo me da pena que una de las instituciones más reconocidas del país aún maneje información tan obsoleta, el folleto que otorgan es en base a la Encuesta Nacional de Nutrición 2012, hay encuestas más recientes, la norma oficial la cuál la última revisión también tiene más de 6 años, los ""Alimentos de mayor consumo por el hospital Salvador Zubirán de 1996"" (hace más de 20 años), el Instituto de salud pública tiene publicaciones muy recientes acerca del panorama de salud en México, y no se diga del Instituto Salvador Zubirán, se siguen dando recomendaciones muy obsoletas, como insistir en los 8 vasos de agua, hace un tiempo la OMS aclaró que el consumo de agua tiene que satisfacer las necesidades de la persona, a menos que esta sufra algún padecimiento específico como problemas renales, ascitis, etc. Siguen utilizando el sistema de intercambios cuando el plato del bien comer es un material más preciso; y para acabar el área de actividad física también es muy simplista, la persona del video que hace ejercicio no trae la ropa adecuada y no realiza los ejercicios de manera adecuada. Soy nutrióloga, me gusta tomar estos cursos para ver qué tipo de material está accesible para la gente en general, estoy segura que si se dan una vuelta por otros cursos que ofrecen en esta misma plataforma será de gran utilidad para mejorar este curso, como nutrióloga y como mexicana me dio mucha verguenza ver este material, y entonces caigo en cuenta del porque tenemos la crisis de salud que tenemos.",By Amaranta P,"Nov 20, 2019",1,nutricion-obesidad-sobrepeso

"Very steep learning curve, especially in the beginning. the professor does not have a very engaging way of presenting his material. Also unfortunately he always requires to first think theoretical and then apply some of the learned content this for yourself. However teaching works the other way around:1) what is the problem we are facing?2) how can we solve that problem (practically)?3) how and why does this solution work (theoretically)?this is proven to be much easier to learn new things and get started. Instead i think this course is set-up for people to struggle by themselves, which i find very frustrating and its not teaching! I ended up teaching myself through trial and error and lots of google search. So what am i paying you for then?Disappointing",By Stefan H,"Mar 27, 2019",1,r-programming
"It was difficult to follow the programming exercises because many of it had already been written. I think it would be more useful to learn one framework instead of using both keras and tensorflow in one course. I still don't know how to debug any of these frameworks. Without the forums, it would be very difficult to pass the assignments. Sometimes there were bugs in the jupyter notebook, sometimes typos that were misleading. As a result, it took me many hours stuck on one assignment. It would be good if these comments are taken into account for the future classes of this course.

Avoid this course by all means. This is absolutely the worst course that I have ever enrolled and seriously I still can't understand how coursera allows such courses to exist. The material is very basic and it has a single reference for a paid book but the absolutely worst part is that the GRADING SYSTEM DEPENDS ON THE AVERAGE EVALUATION OF TWO OTHER RANDOM CLASSMATES. So you realize that even if your submission is perfect you end up getting random grades depending on the mood of your classmates and you can't do anything about it.

It's not informative.,By Amber Y,"Jul 06, 2017",1,financial-planning
"【Now you know Prof. Xuhu Wan, please avoid his course in HKUST】0. Course Equivalence😐This course basically covers 50% content of MATH2411 Applied Statistics (I heard there is ISOM2500 that is similar to MATH2411?). Accidentally I took 2411 right before this winter when this course is out, so I found this course quite disappointing because I expect some practical manipulation of Python is covered while it doesn't. More is discussed in #3.

1. Teaching ☹If you have the experience of recording a video presentation eight hours before the deadline, with scripts written three days before and you hadn't recited or even gone through it in these three days, you will find the professor the same unpassionate. You will find his tone flat enough and gestures unnatural enough as if he is not emphasizing on anything but focusing to recite his scripts. You will find him lag a lot at strange and unnatural spots as if his brain goes blank and he quickly reads the copy of scripts next to the camera.

I thought business people cares a lot about presentation, but I was wrong.

2. Subtitle 😡There are tons of me steaks in the subtitles, not only tipos but also worlds of cellar pronunciation. 
(There are tons of mistakes in the subtitle, not only typos but also words of similar pronunciation.)

I enable subtitle because I sometimes can‘t understand the professor's perfect Mainland accent, but it turns out the subtitle is on his side but not my side. 

I thought business people are very strict about the material that comes along with their presentation, that they always carefully spellcheck every sentence. But I was wrong.

3. Content 😐3.1 Overall:
Please rename this course ""Python and applied statistics"". The professor spends sooooo much time talking about the statistics concepts and spends soooo little time applying the knowledge to financial analysis. It is not about ""Statistics for Financial Analysis"". Replace the data he uses for demonstration with GPA of every student and it becomes ""Statistics for Being HKUST President"" or ""Statistics for Anything"". I feel I am taking an introduction course to statistics and financial analysis is just an excuse the teacher use to show us the content he teaches is somewhat useful.

3.2 Pace:
You MAY find the pace quite fast because:
    The teacher throws many statistics concepts
    The teacher cannot fully explain the concepts (or it is not a 4 week course) so he moves on before you ever (perhaps never will) digest the previous concepts

This is extremely annoying in week 4, e.g. Multiple Linear Regression is taught without introducing a single formula, merely Python codes and black boxes behind them. (Actually this is the way I originally expect the professor to do, but it is quite inconsistent with the style in week 1-3)

You MAY find the pace quite slow because:
    After all this course introduces formulas and codes and let you to use them without knowing why. 

So I would say this is a 4-day course if you can spare 1 hour each day. After all you are not asked ""why"" but only ""how"". If you haven't taken MATH2411 or ISOM, you can spend more time on week 2 & 3 to understand the underlying knowledge. Week 1 is simple and week 4 is needless to comprehend.

4. Jupyter Notebook (JN for short) 😡4.1 Poor Exercise
Almost useless. Just a copy of the codes appeared in the video, with some variables assigned None instead of the correct expression. Your job is to change the lines of variable assignment (usually one or two lines), and the rest is done for you. Some notebooks are even 100% done for you, and all you need to do is look at it and appreciate. Even if you are fiddling with provided exercises, you don't know how to use JN, because...

4.2 Irresponsible adoption of JN
If you want to do some real exercise, you may want to append empty cells below the given content and type codes from scratch. But oh, this course does not teach you how to use JN! It just throw you a tutorial link of how to INSTALL JN ON YOUR COMPUTER{https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook}. What a shame!

Quickly gone through the linked tutorial, it assumes you have installed multiple instance of Python on your desktop, and know basics of pip, conda, docker, and virtual env, and teaches you how to install and configure JN in various dev. environments. But you just mentioned we can use Coursera's pre-installed JN out-of-the-box, why you want us to learn that huh? And to create cells, run cells, run several cells in order, run all, and other basic operations, is hidden in the last seconds of GIFs, not explicitly explained.
I guess the professor is TOO UNRESPONSIBLE to not only teach students how to use JN himself, but also SPEND AT LEAST SOME TIME to check if the external tutorial really ""explains how to use Jupyter Notebooks"". Please, not every one taking this course is CS student like me, SBM students they may not know how to use Python stuff.

5. Coursera Technical 😐Quizzes do not provide correct answer. So it is not that helpful. But getting 80% is not that hard either. But given the assumption that you can't use JN (explained in #4.), you lose at least 10% in Quiz 3 and 20% in Quiz 4. Oh that hurts! (Since Notebook 4.4 is done for you, another 20% in Quiz 4 related to JN is okay.)",By Zeyu H,"Jan 20, 2019",1,python-statistics-financial-analysis

Moreover, in case you cannot install the needed GraphLab/TuriCreate SW package (only MacOS or Unix, for Windows not always working, as for me also!) then you're basically left alone with finding a) the SW packages you need (I took scikit, numpy, pandas) and the corresponding commands (because the entire course explains ONLY commands for Graphlab, NOT for the other packages) - this is BIG extra work you need to do on your own. Now the big joke is that all other courses in the specialization are NOT based on Graphlab, but on the other packages I mentioned ;).

My peer reviewers seem to be unable to comprehend the basic fundamentals of the English language. It is very frustrating to receive feedback that is inaccurate with nothing objective to add. This happened not once or twice but over and over again. I've had my wife (who has several degrees and writes as a profession, along with my GED teacher, to review my work and they are baffled right along with me as to why my peers fail my work assignments.

"This is the hardest course so far in the Specialization. I don't know whether it's me who is lacking the knowledge to fully comprehend the material, or it is because the material wasn't presented well enough. The experience was quite frustrating, and lost the motivation that I had been carrying through the previous 3 courses.I appreciate Andrew's efforts in delivering the lectures with the aim to present most complex materials as intuitively as possible, but still I feel, because of the complexity involved with CNNs, the material need more explanations, and maybe extending the course duration to 6 weeks will provide more opportunity to the instructors to present the matter more clearly.Quite remarkably, the programming exercises fell short on my expectation. It was not useful more than just a simple syntax-check exercise for TensorFlow/Keras/Python. It gives a false sense of achievement, when, in fact, I feel myself far from learning the theoretical underpinnings of the various algorithms explained throughout the course.To conclude, by completing the course, I believe that you surely would get to know the vocabulary used in CNNs and would be aware of the algorithms developed in the domain, but you won't learn enough to implement these algorithms from scratch yourself.",By Md.

"I'm now one week in and I have to say I was surprised about the poor quality of the course. the information within the course is good although some things aren't really regarded as basics BUT all videos so far are with poor audio quality, and just a few powerpoint slides with some pictures of graphs.. I feel like I'm in university again. it's hard to enjoy the content cause it's so ""black and white"" and not engaging enough. it would be great to have better prepared courses in which maybe the people directly talk to you via good quality video and audio so you feel more inclined to follow what they say.

Very basic introduction. Would have liked a little more substance than just the QnA section with some people in the field and a couple short readings. This entire course could have been the first week in a real course. I also think the quizzes could have been better.

"I find it unacceptable that the grader still had the same old problems from months ago. Adding notes directly to the python notebooks is not that difficult. #Return 4 significant digits, etc. Plus, the grader output is not always useful. I execute the function in the python notebook, for whatever reason it does not fail, it works. The grader is more sensitive as it should be but it would be more meaningful at least it mentioned which line it has failed or which cell or which function. The quizes during the videos seems a bit too random. I expect, if you are interrupting a video, you would be asking a question whose answer would be relevant for the later part of the video. Those pop-ups feels like unannounced midterm exams. There is already a full quiz section for this.Perhaps my expectations were too high for this course. ",By Ozge Y,"Jun 23, 2019",2,ds

Not a great course for beginners tbh.... it jumped a bit from topic to topic and all of a sudden certain jargon was used making it difficult to follow some parts of the lecture.

"First, I would like to say that with the exception of ONE exam, I was able to take all the tests WITHOUT WATCHING THE VIDEOS. That shows that this is a poorly put together course. Secondly, this course did NOT cover CHILD NUTRITION, it covered general nutrition. There was nothing helpful in regards to meal planning with children (although there was useful information in the Lunch Packing Video.) Although it claims the project at the end of the course is optional, it will not let me complete the course without doing the project. I find that extremely frustrating. This course offered a lot of great information (even if it was a weird combo of factual/opinionated) I was frustrated by the fact that this course is OBVIOUSLY geared towards the upper middle class/rich instead of the the everyday blue-collar family.

I totally disagree with the whole concept that there is any platform where threats are a good idea. I would have like to have seen more clarity in the lectures about core and non-core violations. The lecture veered off into stories about well's Fargo, Martha Stewart, David Letterman and political figures. I would have liked to have seen the quizzes do a better job of reflecting the lectures instead of being a game of chance. Or, whack a mole. Mostly, I found this course to be a bunch of crap mostly because of the stories which had no real bearing on the course.

"I've taken several Coursera courses, and this is the worst one by far. Yes there is useful information, but it is very poorly taught.

I would think Duke University would be embarrassed to put their name on this course. After all, that's where Dan Ariely calls home, so the university has talent, but it is not on display here.

I learned basics in python. Instructor is too good.,By ASHUTOSH G,"Apr 02, 2020",3,python
"Generally this is a really amazing course. Dr. Ng presented it in a way that it can be understood relatively easily considering the difficulty of content. However, there are a few things that degraged the course that can otherwise  be rated five stars. First, the mathematial derivations are not clear enouth. Many vital steps of derivation in the forward and backward propagation are skipped and only the final expressions are given. It did a lot harm to the completeness and rigorousness of the course. As for me, I can derive the missing steps by myself as I learned calculus and the linear algebra. But it still good to include the derivations for our convenience. It's not necessary to derive them in the lecture, but still we need some materials that document the derivations.  Second, Jupyter notebook is not a good choice for the course. The code for each assignment is not so easy. It's better to write the functions in separate files and write a main function to call them. The description is better written in a PDF file. If it is done this way, it will save me a lot of efforts by getting rid of scrowing the mouse up and down repeatedly to check every function.

"I did not have a lot of experience in machine learning, so this course was very good in the aspect of introducing people to machine learning concepts. Most of the times the material was very well explained, and I like the concept of the tutor writing on the screen at the same time they are presenting, personally it helps me more. Some of the quizzes were easy so you did not need a lot of preparation, some of them were more difficult or troublesome, like the quiz for Deep Learning. I also liked the graphlab module, I think that learning how to use it will help me with my own work. However, as this course does not really go in depth in the algorithms themselves, I feel that after one month and a half I have a basic idea, but I haven't learned much about how to implement machine learning on my own even in basic things, while other courses have more or less the same time frame and are more dense in their material. In my opinion, this whole introductory course would just be just splitted and each of these intrductory weeks would be appended as the first week of the subsequent modules to come. Because anyways, after 4 months in the specialization, if somebody continues to the recommender systems module for example, he/she would have forgotten the basics of this so they would need to cover again the recommender systems week in this course. And from the other hand, if some introduction is again repeated in the subsequent modules, then why have this introductory course anyways?Thanks.",By Sofia P,"Mar 12, 2016",3,ml-foundations

"Broadly speaking, this is a good course. However, the feeling is that it should be twice as long and with more videos. There is simply not enough instruction to facilitate clear learning and completion of this course is down to an individual's desire to read around and problem solve.In particular, the programming assignments - whilst not technically difficult, lack clear articulation of expectation, which is compounded by pythons slightly inconvenient handling of matrices. Writing vectorised code which involves 1 x N or N x 1 matrices and transpositions often results in zero marks; with no clue whether the code is wrong, the student has misunderstood the expectation  or python is refusing to recognise a N x 1 matrix. This could br helped by including more discriptions about the data sets and the variables being used, as well as the expectation of the output.There are a lot of positives about this course, the videos are well made and are clear. Excellent supplementary learning if you're doing undergraduate Linear Algebra or other Machine Learning courses; just a bit too cramped for a standalone course (even with the others in the specialisation being well understood). Perhaps a four course could be added to this specialisation for ""The Basics of Python for Machine Learning"" where a student covers all the relevant coding knowledge?",By Harrison B,"Apr 18, 2020",3,pca-machine-learning

Had I known this I would have started that way, instead I took 3 and tried to take 5, it does not work that way. If you are looking at cost, be sure to review the those options.  While I didn't think I needed the other courses, I found it helpful to refresh my memory and it also helped understand the direction of the course material and assignments in detail.   Even though it may look simple, always take notes during the lecture videos because by the time you get to the quizzes you might find your self stumped and the notes are great reminders on the outline principles of the subject. No, taking notes will not give you the answer, its not designed that way. ",By Sheryl H,"Mar 27, 2017",4,getting-started-with-essay-writing
